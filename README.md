# React IDLE Reptile Rack
A personal project I am working on to help develop my understanding of **React**, whilst bringing my love for reptiles and reptile keeping into my work.
The game focuses around purchasing reptiles and reptile enclosures, then raising and breeding them for profit, or just for fun.

**This game is still very early in development, but currently features:**
- A 5x5 grid which can be purchased and used as enclosures.
- A terrain selector, allowing you to choose between 3 different types of enclosure to purchase.
- A random shop that generates snakes with different stats like age, price, sex, morphs, and more.
- A money system, that allows you to purchase these enclosures and reptiles.

**In future updates I will be adding:**
- The ability to attempt to breed reptiles together.
- More updated graphics, so enclosures look like enclosures and the reptiles aren't just text.#
- More terrain and reptile types
- Aging and hunger decay over time to all reptiles
- Viruses & quarantine
- Shop updating daily

## Controls 
Change selected cube: ```Arrow Keys```

Change selected terrain: ```Square Brackets```

Purchase enclosure: ```Enter```

Purchase Reptile / Put reptile in enclosure: ```Drag reptile from shop onto enclosure using the mouse```

## Setup
**Need Node.js version >= 6.0.0**

Download the application from the git repository.
To run the application, open the terminal in the root directory of the project and type

```npm start```

This will run the application in the terminal and make it accessible on

```http://localhost:3000```


If you get an error saying 
```react-scripts not found``` 
it might be React has not been installed locally, to fix this type 

```npm install react``` 

in the root of the project directory.
